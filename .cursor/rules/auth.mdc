# Auth
- MUST use supabase auth
- MUST have separate abstraction files from callsites for auth
- MUST use JWT for authentication
- MUST NOT have password authentication.
- MUST use Google as auth provider
- ALWAYS use `supabase.auth.getUser()` to protect pages and user data.
- NEVER trust `supabase.auth.getSession()` inside server code such as middleware. It isn't guaranteed to revalidate the Auth token.
