# UI/UX
- The UI component library is shadcn
- YOU MUST use `shadcn` instead of `shadcn-ui`
- You can access Shadcn documentation through @shadcn
- All UI implementations should work on mobile, tablet, and desktop. Each size can have different styling and components.
- The styling should be done with Tailwind CSS
- All alerts and errors should use Alert component
- Every component should be user friendly, including instructions and error messages
- Every component should have aesthetically pleasing design
- Every component should follow material design guidelines
- The UX should be intuitive and easy to use
- The UX should delight and surprise the user
- The UX color scheme should be black and white/gradient with dash of color
- Plan limitations should be displayed only when the user has reached the limit of the current plan
- All UI components MUST have separate reusable base components for unified styling and functionality with at least color and variant parameters
- When referring to environment variables, you MUST validate that the variable is defined in the .env file
- Do not change anything in the layout unless asked specifically to do so. You can add new features but do not change existing ones.

# Design
- The UI MUST have clear visual hierarchy
- Must ALWAYS use the common `spinner` component for loading state

# Shadcn
- You are NOT allowed to generate/create the files yourself
- Add new shadcn components with `npx shadcn add` command
- YOU MUST use `shadcn` instead of `shadcn-ui`
- Must install the components and NEVER create them yourself
- The components in `components/ui` MUST NOT be directly edited or new ones created, these are only created through `shadcn`

# Components
- MUST create separate component for every shadcn component which sets default colors etc. for consistent UI across components

# Buttons
- Every button should use "pointer" cursor
- Every button MUST have a icon. On the left if it is a action such as save, on the right if it is a navigation button
- All buttons MUST follow the current design system
- Buttons MUST be fully rounded
- They MUST use either primary or secondary color from the color palette (black, white)
- IF a button uses secondary (white) color, it MUST have a light grey border
- IF a button only has an icon, it MUST be a circle
