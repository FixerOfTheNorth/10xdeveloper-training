# React
- Always use functional React
- Always use React hooks
- ALWAYS use contexts when the hook data becomes something that multiple components need to access
- Never use default export for components, always use named exports
- Always export fallback component if the component has data loading or hooks, which uses only Skeleton components
- You MUST use `lucide-react` for icons
- MUST use already existing hooks for data operations
- Every component MUST take `className` and `data-testid` props

# useEffect
- DO NOT use useEffect for hacking functionality that should exist somewhere else. THIS IS FRAGILE CODE!

## React hooks
- Always use hooks for data operations
- Hooks MUST NEVER connect to the database directly
- Hooks MUST ALWAYS use API endpoints for data processing

# Loading state
- Use common Spinner component for loading states
