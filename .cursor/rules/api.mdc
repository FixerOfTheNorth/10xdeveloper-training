# API endpoints
- API should follow the RESTful CRUD API design (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods per action) (e.g. POST `/users/<userID>`)
- Every API endpoint must always export the RequestBody and ResponseBody types (Get, Put, Post, Delete)
- API endpoints that require authentication MUST get the user data from the JWT token
- API endpoints should only handle data and the detailed functionality should be located in the `lib` folder
