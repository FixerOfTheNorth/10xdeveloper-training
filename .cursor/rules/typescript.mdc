# Typescript
- NEVER use `any` type
- ALWAYS write separate typings for complex parameters, which should always be documented with full code blocks for type and every property (with empty line separating properties)
- When documenting types etc. always document every property separately with block comment instead of one block comment for the whole type
- Prefer using `satisfies` over `as` for type casting as it is more type safe
- Every function MUST be documented

# Example commenting 

/**
 * <Description and use for the interface>
 */
export interface CustomInsightAnswer {
  /**
   * <Description of the property with example>
   */
  property1: string;

  /**
   * <Description of the property with example>
   */
  property2: string;
}
